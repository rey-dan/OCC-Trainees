// Activity: Exploring Common JS Built-in Methods

// Objective: Practice using common JS built-in methods to perform various operations.

// Instructions:
// 1. Create an HTML file with a heading<h1> that says "Common JS Built-in Methods".
    a. filename: activity 1
    b. title: Common JS Built-in Methods
// 2. Create a JavaScript file and link it to the HTML file.
    a. script.js
// 3. In the JavaScript file, you will find comments describing different tasks that need to be performed using common JS built-in methods. Your task is to write the code to complete these tasks.
// 4. The tasks to be completed are as follows:
//    a. Calculate the square root of a given number.
//    b. Generate a random number between 1 and 10.
//    c. Convert a string representation of a number to an actual number.
//    d. Check if a value is not a number.
//    e. Convert a number to a string.


// Your code implementation goes here:

// Calculate the square root of a given number


// Generate a random number between 1 and 10


// Convert a string representation of a number to an actual number


// Check if a value is not a number


// Convert a number to a string
